## About the Project

FocusCam uses computer vision and your webcam to monitor your attention levels, ensuring you stay engaged with tasks and minimizing distractions.

---

## Inspiration

The idea was born from our team's struggle with maintaining focus while studying and doing homework. We pondered, "What if our computers could notify us when we're losing attention?" That's how FocusCam was born.

---

## Key Learnings

- **Computer Vision Basics:** Delved into how cameras detect facial nuances using vector math and tracking facial features.
  
- **User Privacy:** Ensured data was processed locally without storing any footage.
  
- **User Interface Design:** Created a user-friendly and non-intrusive interface.

---

## How We Built It

- **Tools:** Utilized OpenCV for computer vision and Electron for the app interface.

- **Detection Algorithm:** Developed to distinguish between reading/thinking and distraction.

- **Real-time Feedback:** Users receive gentle reminders to refocus after a minute of distraction.

- **Privacy:** Data is processed locally; no footage is saved or transmitted.

- **Challenges:** Implementing Gaze Tracking was a significant challenge initially.
